In consideration of the mutual understandings and covenants set forth herein, the Parties agree as follows:\",\n  \"Sections\": {\n    \"1. PURPOSE\": \"This MOU seeks to provide a process by which ISDH will perform quantitative polymerase (qPCR) analysis laboratory analyses for cyanobacteria and cyanotoxins. Cyanobacteria and cyanotoxins present an immediate and dangerous health hazard to the drinking water for 50% of the population of the State of Indiana. The IDEM Office Water Quality, Drinking Water Branch (DWB) is currently evaluating the extent of the threat of cyanotoxins to drinking water treatment plants (DWTP's) and the effectiveness of DWTP treatment operations on removing cyanotoxins from the finished drinking water going out to the public. IDEM has encountered the neurotoxin, Microcystin as high as 29µg/L in the water entering a drinking water treatment plant. The generally accepted limits in water is 1µg/L Microcystin. Fortunately, testing determined that the DWTP was able to remove the neurotoxin from the finished water served to the public.Currently, no reasonable analytical capacity exists within the State of Indiana to analyze the full range of toxins produced by cyanobacteria. Limited analytical capacity exists outside of the State of Indiana to analyze and respond to emergencies involving cyanotoxins. This MOU will provide a cooperative agreement for IDEM and ISDH to leverage respective expertise and equipment to respond to routine and emergency cyanobacteria and cyanotoxin testing. ISDH has existing polymerase chain reaction (PCR) instrumentation and expertise that is suitable for the qPCR analyses. ISDH requires other equipment to prepare samples for the qPCR method and funding for ongoing reagents, standards and expendables. Cooperation with ISDH will result in the following benefits:\",\n    \"Benefits\": [\n      \"Will save over $45,000.00 per year in analytical costs.\",\n      \"Will leverage existing ISDH equipment and expertise.\",\n      \"Will build in-state expertise and capacity to evaluate cyanobacteria and cyanotoxins.\",\n      \"Will keep ISDH in direct contact with the State of cyanobacteria and cyanotoxins in the state.\",\n      \"Will give IDEM and ISDH the tools to more rapidly respond to and evaluate cyanotoxin emergencies.\",\n      \"Will relieve the DWB sampling schedule, since the samples can be dropped off daily as opposed to shipped overnight for delivery by noon on Wednesday.\"\n    ]\n  },\n  \"Page\": \"1 of 8\"\n}\n```\n\nThis JSON captures the detailed information contained within the provided document image."
