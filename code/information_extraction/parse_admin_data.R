#Aggregate by agency Field 14  and Field 16 on first page.

#Aggregate by vendor ID (Field 23) and vendor name (Field 24) on first page.
# We can then see if certain vendors are contracting with multiple agencies.

#Summarize Field 29, Field 30, Field 31, Field 32.
These are all vendor characteristics, minority owned, vendor status etc. 
#Potentially explore which vendors get renewed, etc. 
#One of the fields is specific to subcontractors so potentially see which services/contracts require more complex arrangements.
#Summarize Field 33.
#This is the presence/absence of renewal language.
