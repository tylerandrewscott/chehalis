    "## Notes on Donut for Form Detection\n",
    "\n",
    "### Advantages:\n",
    "1. **No OCR needed** - Donut processes images directly\n",
    "2. **Document understanding** - Trained specifically on documents\n",
    "3. **Simple to use** - Just asks \"what type of document is this?\"\n",
    "4. **Fast** - Single pass through the model\n",
    "\n",
    "### Limitations:\n",
    "1. The base model may need fine-tuning for specific form types\n",
    "2. Classification categories are pre-defined (but include \"form\")\n",
    "3. Less flexible than example-based matching\n",
    "\n",
    "### Next Steps:\n",
    "1. Fine-tune Donut on your specific forms if needed\n",
    "2. Use the extracted form pages for downstream processing\n",
    "3. Consider using Donut for form field extraction later"
